A kiss and ride facility is a part of a park and ride facility
where commuters who are passengers in non-transit
vehicles are dropped off to board a mass transportation
vehicle.

Operating Practices
Schedules are determined by a combination of factors.
Normally they are a function of demand, which is why 2-3
times as many buses are operated during peak
commuting hours than at other times. Many routes in
larger cities, in fact only operate during the peak hours.

Such centers may be located at rail stations, intercity bus
terminals, or ferry terminals, and may be shared with other
transit agencies. Small and medium-sized agencies might
have one center in the central business district; larger
agencies might have several additional centers scattered
throughout the suburbs at major shopping malls or parkand-ride lots. In some instances, a timed-transfer system
is used, in which all buses converge on the transit center
at a specific time to exchange passengers.

The type of vehicle used on a route is determined by the
maximum number of riders expected at any point on the
route, with the result that at other points along the route-especially the beginning and ending points--the bus may
be largely empty. Also, because of the peak-directional
flow nature of commuting, where most traffic goes towards
the central business district in the morning and away from
it in the afternoon, buses operating in the opposite
direction necessarily carry few people, but must be
operated to get back out to the end of the line for the next
peak-direction trip.

Bus and Trolleybus Transit Agency Data
Largest Bus and Trolleybus Transit Agencies
Each variable chosen to rank agencies by size will yield a different list. Vehicles vary widely in
size; transfers result in double-counting some passengers; expenses are largely determined by
wage rate and benefit levels; employee counts may include numerous part-time employees
and not include contract personnel. For these reasons, listed are the top 20 transit systems
based on four categories: Passenger Miles, Number of Revenue Vehicles, Vehicle Revenue
Miles and Unlinked Passenger Trips.

(a) Directional route miles count the number of miles used by routes in each direction of travel, regardless of how many routes
use that stretch of guideway. Exclusive right-of-way (ROW) is reserved at all times; controlled ROW only part of the time
(usually just during peak hours); and the rest of the reported miles are mixed with regular traffic. Some double-counting
occurs when more than one transit agency or contractor uses the same fixed guideway.
(b) Largest based on total directional route miles
(c) Includes about 450 reporting bus agencies.

General demand response service is not required by
law and is not subject to the restrictions imposed on
complementary paratransit service. The transit agency
may limit the service to certain people or it may be
available to anyone. Some such services operate during
late-night and weekend hours in place of fixed-route
services.

Demand Response
Highlights……
See National Totals on page 68.

User-side subsidy service is a transportation
arrangement where the rider's cost of transportation is
partially subsidized by the transit agency. The user is the
rider who pays a reduced fare. A typical user-side subsidy
program is operated through taxicab operators or a
brokerage system which may charge a per-ride fee for
handling the rider's transportation arrangements.

Demand response is the most widely available transit
service, with over 5,000 transit agencies providing it.
However, most of those agencies limit the service to
persons with disabilities, their attendants and companions,
and older Americans.
Demand Response (also called paratransit or dial-aride) is comprised of passenger cars, vans or small buses
operating in response to calls from passengers or their
agents to the transit operator, who then dispatches a
vehicle to pick up the passengers and transport them to
their destinations. A demand response operation is
characterized by the following: (a) The vehicles do not
operate over a fixed route or on a fixed schedule except,
perhaps, on a temporary basis to satisfy a special need;
and (b) typically, the vehicle may be dispatched to pick up
several passengers at different pick-up points before
taking them to their respective destinations and may even
be interrupted en route to these destinations to pick up
other passengers. The following types of operations fall
under the above definitions provided they are not on a
scheduled fixed route basis: many origins-many
destinations, many origins-one destination, one originmany destinations, and one origin-one destination.

Types of Vehicles
Almost all demand response service is operated with
vehicles less than 30 feet in length since generally only a
few people are on board the vehicle at any time. Despite
their small size, most such vehicles have two doors similar
to transit buses, though the rear door (used for
wheelchairs) may actually open behind the vehicle instead
of towards the side.
A van has a typical seating capacity of 5 to 15 passengers
and is classified as a van by vehicle manufacturers. A
modified van (body-on-chassis van) is a standard van
that has undergone some structural changes by another
company, usually made to increase its size and
particularly its height. The seating capacity of modified
vans is approximately 9 to 18 passengers.
Small transit buses (see the Bus section for definitions)
are also used by a small number of transit agencies.

results.
(a) Cost includes amount paid to manufacturer or agent. Not all
orders were reported. Each year of a multi-year order is counted as a
separate order.

Types of Service
Complementary paratransit service is required by law
for those persons with disabilities and others not able to
use fixed-route service. Generally it must operate in the
same areas and during the same hours. The fare is
limited to twice the fixed-route fare. Service may be the
fixed-route bus agency or by a completely separate
agency.

Demand response service uses vans and minibuses because
very few people are on board at one time. This vehicle is part of
the Omnitran fleet, serving the San Bernardino Valley in
California.

Low-floor vans have a level floor in the entire passengerseating area. Only a short retractable ramp is necessary
to accommodate wheelchairs and those who cannot
bridge the gap between van and street level.

Accessibility
An accessible vehicle is a public transportation revenue
vehicle that is usable and provides allocated space and/or
priority seating for individuals who use wheelchairs.
High-floor vans require the rider to climb 2 or 3 steps
from street level. Such vans accommodate people who
use wheelchairs and other riders who cannot climb steps
by using a retractable lift that raises and lowers persons
and equipment between street and van floor levels.

Minnesota's St. Cloud Metropolitan Transit Commission is one of
many agencies operating low-floor demand response vans.

Largest Demand Response Transit Agencies
Each variable chosen to rank agencies by size will yield a different list. Vehicles vary widely in size; transfers
result in double-counting some passengers; expenses are largely determined by wage rate and benefit levels;
employee counts may include numerous part-time employees and not include contract personnel. For these
reasons, listed are the top 20 transit systems based on four categories: Passenger Miles, Number of Revenue
Vehicles, Vehicle Revenue Miles and Unlinked Passenger Trips.

Vehicle ferries have at least one deck for vehicles, with
additional decks for passengers. The largest are in the
Seattle, WA area, and are over 460 feet long,
accommodating 2,500 passengers and 218 vehicles.
Such ferries are normally square-ended to allow vehicle
access and egress.

Ferryboat
Highlights……
See National Totals on page 78.

Ferryboat is a transit mode comprised of vessels carrying
passengers and/or vehicles over a body of water, and that
are generally steam or diesel-powered.
When at least one terminal is within an urbanized area, it
is urban ferryboat service.
Such service excludes
international, rural, rural interstate, island, and urban park
ferries.
Transit ferryboat service is provided in about 30
metropolitan areas and small cities, where offshore
islands, bays, and wide rivers preclude any other type of
service at a reasonable cost. In a few places, service may
operate between two points on the same shore.

Washington State Ferries operates the nation's largest fleet of
passenger-auto ferries on Puget Sound in the Seattle and
Tacoma, Washington areas.

In a few far-northern areas, service does not operate in
winter. Service may occasionally be curtailed during
periods of heavy fog or severe storms for safety reasons.
Ferry service is unique among public transit modes in that
it is subject to U.S. Coast Guard operating and safety
regulations.

Passenger-only ferries have only passenger decks,
though they may also have space for bicycles. They can
range from small boats about 50 feet long holding about
50 people up to the 310-foot long Staten Island ferries in
New York, which can accommodate 6,000 people.
Because they don't have vehicle decks, they need not be
square-ended and may have pointed bows and sideloading. Catamaran (double hull) and hydrofoil (where the
vehicle skims the surface of the water) styles may be used
for high-speed services.

Types of Service
Most ferryboats operate non-stop over short distances in
local service, but in a few cases, a stop may be made at
an intervening island. A number of routes in the Boston,
MA, New York, NY, Providence, RI, San Francisco, CA,
and Seattle, WA areas are several miles long.
Express service may operate in peak-hours bypassing
intervening islands. Alternatively, some trips may be
operated by high-speed or passenger-only ferries
compared to the regular ferry, which could be considered
as express service of a sort.

Fixed Guideways
By federal law, ferryboats are considered a form of fixedguideway transit. Each trip may take a slightly different
course due to water conditions, but the beginning and
ending points are fixed.
This passenger-only ferry is operated by Golden Gate Bridge,
Highway and Transportation District of San Francisco.

Types of Vehicles

Water taxis are very small passenger-only ferries (about
50 feet or less) that may operate in both fixed-route and
on-demand service, depending on the time of day and
patronage levels. They can load and unload very quickly
and operate very frequently, sometimes to several
different points around a harbor or along a river.

A ferryboat is a vessel for carrying passengers and/or
vehicles over a body of water. The vessel is generally a
steam or diesel-powered conventional ferry vessel. It may
also be a hovercraft, hydrofoil or other high speed vessel.
A wide range of boats are used in ferry service, but there
are two basic types.

Vehicle Costs
Only 1-2 ferryboats are built in a 5-year period. Costs vary
from about $250,000 to tens of millions of dollars.

TABLE 111: Ferryboat Fuel Consumption,
Thousands of Gallons

Power Sources and Fuel Consumption
Almost all ferries are powered by diesel, and because of
their massive bulk, have relatively low fuel efficiency-about 0.07 miles per gallon in the year 2002. However,
this is an average of widely varying sizes of boats with
trips hindered by opposing currents.
One compressed natural gas ferry is operated by
Hampton Roads Transit in Norfolk, VA. (This ferry was
out of service in 2003, which is why there are no CNG fuel
consumption data for that year.)

Some ferries use floating docks that rise and fall with
changing water levels. Where water levels are more
stable, the dock may be a permanent structure on land. In
either case a gangway and a vehicle ramp must be
deployed either from the boat or from the dock. On the
busiest ferry routes, a terminal building may have multiple
boarding levels, with gangways deployed for passengers
from the building's upper levels in the same manner as is
done at airports.

Accessibility
A station is a public transportation passenger facility.
An accessible station is a station which provides ready
access, and does not have physical barriers that prohibit
and/or restrict access by individuals with disabilities,
including individuals who use wheelchairs.

Wheelchair accessibility depends on the width and railings
on the gangways, on the steepness of the slope on the
gangways resulting from very high or low water levels, and
on any small gaps in vehicle access ramps (if that is the
only means of access). Special assistance may be
necessary in some cases. When access is directly from a
terminal building, elevators within that building would also
be necessary. Some ferries are not accessible due to
steps at the ends of gangways.

An accessible vehicle is a public transportation revenue
vehicle that does not restrict access, is usable, and
provides allocated space and/or priority seating for
individuals who use wheelchairs.
Because water levels fluctuate due to tides in coastal
areas or drought and high-water conditions on interior
rivers, different methods of access have evolved.

Operating Practices
However, routes many miles long require a 30-60 minute
trip, since average ferry speed is only 8.7 miles per hour.
Such routes would require a minimum of two boats for
anything less than a 60-minute frequency.

The largest passenger-only ferries usually operate on 3060 minute headways while smaller passenger-only ferries
can operate more frequently. Multiple docks at the largest
terminals allow frequencies as low as 10-15 minutes.

Water taxis, because of their very small size, may be able
to operate every 5 minutes or so.

and adjacent suburbs. Service must be operated on a
regular basis by or under contract with a transit operator
for the purpose of transporting passengers within
urbanized areas, or between urbanized areas and outlying
areas. Such rail service, using either locomotive hauled or
self propelled railroad passenger cars, is generally
characterized by multi-trip tickets, specific station to
station fares, railroad employment practices and usually
only one or two stations in the central business district.
Intercity rail service is excluded, except for that portion of
such service that is operated by or under contract with a
public transit agency for predominantly commuter
services, which means that for any given trip segment
(i.e., distance between any two stations), more than 50%
of the average daily ridership travels on the train at least
three times a week.

Rail
Highlights……
Rail transit services exist in over 50 metropolitan areas
and small cities, and the number grows almost yearly.
A mode is the system for carrying transit passengers
described by specific right-of-way, technology and
operational features. The most common rail modes are:
Commuter rail (also called metropolitan rail, regional
rail, or suburban rail) is an electric or diesel propelled
railway for urban passenger train service consisting of
local short distance travel operating between a central city

Heavy rail (metro, subway, rapid transit, or rapid rail) is
an electric railway with the capacity for a heavy volume of
traffic. It is characterized by high speed and rapid
acceleration passenger rail cars operating singly or in
multi-car trains on fixed rails; separate rights-of-way from

which all other vehicular and foot traffic are excluded;
sophisticated signaling, and high platform loading. If the
service were converted to full automation with no onboard
personnel, the service would be considered an automated
guideway.

Light rail (streetcar, tramway, or trolley) is lightweight
passenger rail cars operating singly (or in short, usually
two-car, trains) on fixed rails in right-of-way that is not
separated from other traffic for much of the way. Light rail

vehicles are typically driven electrically with power being
drawn from an overhead electric line via a trolley or a
pantograph.

operating without an onboard crew. Service may be on a
fixed schedule or in response to a passenger activated call
button. The places with automated guideways are Detroit,
MI, Indianapolis, IN, Jacksonville, FL, Las Colinas, TX,
Miami, FL, and Morgantown, WV. Automated guideways
in non-transit settings such as airports and hospital
campuses are more common.

Other modes are:
Aerial tramway is an electric system of aerial cables with
suspended powerless passenger vehicles. The vehicles
are propelled by separate cables attached to the vehicle
suspension system and powered by engines or motors at
a central location not on board the vehicle. Only two such
transit operations exist in New York City and at Mountain
Village, CO. All other aerial tramways are at ski areas or
at tourist sites.

Cable car is an electric railway with individually controlled
transit vehicles attached to a moving cable located below
the street surface and powered by engines or motors at a
central location not on board the vehicle. Only one cable
car operation exists in San Francisco, CA.

Automated guideway transit (personal rapid transit,
group rapid transit, people mover) is an electric railway
(single or multi-car trains) of guided transit vehicles

83

Inclined plane is a railway operating over exclusive rightof-way on steep grades (slopes) with powerless vehicles
propelled by moving cables attached to the vehicles and
powered by engines or motors at a central location not on
board the vehicle. The special tramway type of vehicles
have passenger seats that remain horizontal while the
undercarriage (truck) is angled parallel to the slope.
Chattanooga, TN, Dubuque, IA, Johnstown, PA, and
Pittsburgh, PA (2 inclines) are the only places with inclines
used in regular transit service.

Monorail is an electric railway of guided transit vehicles
operating singly or in multi-car trains. The vehicles are
suspended from or straddle a guideway formed by a single
beam, rail, or tube. Only two transit monorails exist in Las
Vegas, NV and Seattle, WA. Their most common use is in
the non-transit settings of amusement parks. If the trains
do not have an onboard crew, they are considered
automated guideways.

An automated guideway car is a guided passenger car
operating under a fully automated system without an
onboard crew. One type is a downtown people mover,
which operates on a loop or shuttle route within the central
business district of a city.

Types of Service
Local service, in the rail context, means trains stop at
every station on a route. For light rail and cable cars
operating on city streets, local service would be analagous
to local bus service, where stops are every block or two
apart.
Most aerial tramway, automated guideway, inclined plane,
and monorail routes are one mile or less long. New York
City Transit also has a few very short heavy rail shuttle
lines, and most heritage trolley lines are also only a few
miles long. Some of these operations may operate in a
loop and connect, often at a transfer center or rail station,
to major routes for travel to more far-flung destinations
Express service speeds up longer trips, especially in
major metropolitan areas during heavily-patronized peak
commuting hours, by operating long distances without
stopping. In New York, Chicago, and other areas, express
trains even have separate tracks for at least part of their
routes.
Limited-stop service is a hybrid between local and
express service, where not all stations and stops are
served. An example is a pair of closely-spaced trains that
both stop at the most heavily-patronized stations on a line.
For the other stations, the first train stops at every other
station, while the following train stops at the stations
missed by the first train.

The Newark Airport AirTrain in New Jersey uses monorail
technology, but is an automated guideway since the trains do not
have operators.

A cable car is a streetcar type of passenger car operating
by means of an attachment to a moving cable located
below the street surface and powered by engines or
motors at a central location not on board the vehicle.

Types of Vehicles
Although most service is operated with vehicles purchased
new, a small proportion is operated by vehicles
rehabilitated or rebuilt when they are 10 to 20 years old.
Rehabilitation is the rebuilding of revenue vehicles to
original specifications of the manufacturer. Rebuilding
may include some new components but has less
emphasis on structural restoration than would be the case
in a remanufacturing operation, focusing on mechanical
systems and vehicle interiors.
An aerial tramway car is an unpowered passenger cabin
suspended from a system of aerial cables and propelled
by separate cables attached to the vehicle suspension
system. Engines or motors at a central location, not on
board the vehicle, power the cable system.

Only San Francisco Municipal Railway operates cable cars.

85

A commuter rail car is a commuter rail mode passenger
car--either an unpowered passenger coach that is pulled
or pushed by one or more locomotives, or a selfpropelled passenger car that has an onboard power
source or that draws power from overhead electric wires.
A large proportion of commuter rail cars are doubledecked with upper and lower seating levels.

An inclined plane car is a special type of passenger car
operating up and down slopes on rails via a cable
mechanism.

A locomotive is a power unit vehicle that does not carry
passengers that is used to pull or push commuter rail
passenger coaches. Most locomotives use diesel fuel or
are powered by overhead electric wires or an electrified
third rail. A small number are dual-mode and can operate
either as a diesel or electric vehicle.

The Monongahela Incline is operated by the Port Authority of
Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

This locomotive-hauled Caltrain commuter rail train which
operates in the San Francisco area uses double-deck cars, as do
all commuter rail agencies in western and southern states.
Clearances on old tunnels and bridges in northeastern states,
however, generally allow only single-deck cars.

A light rail car (or streetcar, tram, or trolley car) has
motive capability, is usually driven by electric power taken
from overhead lines, and usually operates much or all of
its route on non-exclusive right-of-way. Sometimes older
cars are refurbished (vintage trolley cars) or newer cars
are built to look like older cars (heritage trolley cars).

A heavy rail car has motive capability, is driven by electric
power taken from a third rail or (rarely, overhead wires),
and is usually operated on exclusive right-of-way.

Light rail trains carry "light" loads of people compared to heavy
rail. This train is operated by Metro Transit in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

This MTA New York City Transit heavy rail train typifies this mode
with very frequent service carrying very "heavy" numbers of
people.

86

A monorail car is a guided passenger car operating on or
suspended from a single rail, beam or tube.

A vintage trolley at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority in San Jose, California.

The Las Vegas monorail in Nevada is not only a means of public
transportation, but also an attraction for tourists.

High-level platforms are generally 18-36 inches above
track level and are used primarily by heavy rail, automated
guideway, and some commuter rail lines. Only high-floor
cars can be used. Platforms can be level with car floors,
the cars could have a lift or a ramp, or the platform could
have a lift, ramp, or mini-platform.

Accessibility
A station is a public transportation passenger facility.
An accessible station is a station that provides ready
access, and does not have physical barriers that prohibit
and/or restrict access by individuals with disabilities,
including individuals who use wheelchairs.
An accessible vehicle is a public transportation revenue
vehicle that does not restrict access, is usable, and
provides allocated space and/or priority seating for
individuals who use wheelchairs.
Historically-protected vehicles, such as the San Francisco
cable cars, have been exempted from accessibility
regulations.
Rail cars accommodate wheelchair-bound and other riders
who cannot climb steps in several different manners:
Street-level boarding is used primarily by light rail and
cable car lines that stop on the street rather than at
stations. Either a low-floor car with a retractable ramp or a
high-floor car with a retractable lift would be required.

This Memphis Area Transit Authority historic light rail car in
Tennessee is a high-floor car with steps at both ends.

Some commuter rail and light rail lines use a mixture of
high-level and low-level platforms on the same line.
Typically, all platforms were originally low-level, but the
most heavily-used stations have been upgraded to highlevel to speed loading and unloading. In such cases, the
cars must have two accessibility options--one for highlevel platforms and one for low-level platforms.
Other rail modes may use any of the accessibility
arrangements

Portland's Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of
Oregon is one of several light rail agencies to operate low-floor
light rail cars.

Low-level platforms are generally about 12-18 inches
above track level and are used primarily by some
commuter rail and light rail lines. Either a low-floor car
with a retractable ramp or a high-floor car with a
retractable lift can be used. Alternatively, the platform can
be level with the car floor or the platform may have a lift,
ramp, or elevated mini-platform.
Heavy rail trains, like this one operated by the Toronto Transit
Commission, are accessible via high-platform ramps.

(a) Data based on 2000 National Transit Database

The Chicago Transit Authority operates all three types of rail fixed
guideway--surface and elevated, shown here, and tunnel.

Fixed Guideways
All rail services are classified as fixed guideways.
A Fixed Guideway is a mass transit facility using and
occupying a separate right-of-way or rail for the exclusive
use of mass transportation and other high-occupancy
vehicles; or using a fixed catenary system usable by other
forms of transportation.
Fixed guideways are generally on the surface, but about
half of heavy rail mileage and short distances of other
types of rail are in tunnel or elevated.

A Toronto Transit Commission subway tunnel near SheppardYonge Station in Toronto.

Vanpool

management company that has its own vehicles and
administers the service. Under either arrangement, many
vanpools serve large private corporations or government
agencies and consist solely of their employees.

Highlights……

Vanpool service generally serves areas far outside the
normal bus service area, or intra-suburban trips where bus
service cannot be justified. The average trip length is
nearly 35 miles, and trips well over 50 miles are not
uncommon.

See National Totals on page 102.

Vanpool service operates primarily from rural and outer
suburban areas into urban area central business districts
or suburban employment centers. Most vanpools serve
large urban areas, though a few states have statewide
programs.

Vanpool fares often vary depending on the number of
people in the vanpool, the size of van used, and the
distance traveled. The driver collects fares (unless there
is a pay-by-mail program), operates the van, and arranges
for maintenance. In return, the driver rides free, may keep
the van at home overnight, and may often use it for
personal use within prescribed limits.

The vast majority of vanpools are privately-operated, are
not available to the public, and are not considered public
transportation, which is limited to the several dozen transit
agencies that do fund and operate public vanpools.

The transit agency, or sometimes another local
governmental unit, runs a vanpool matching service to
recruit new riders and usually pays insurance, fuel, and
maintenance costs. If the number of vans involved is
large enough, the transit agency may perform the
maintenance itself, though the usual procedure is for the
driver to take the van to a local automobile dealer.

Vanpool mode is comprised of vans (and very rarely,
small buses and other vehicles) operating as a ridesharing
arrangement, providing transportation to a group of
individuals traveling directly between their homes and a
regular destination within the same geographical area.
The vehicles have a minimum seating capacity of seven
persons, including the driver. It is considered mass transit
service if it is operated by a public entity or is one in which
a public entity owns, purchases, or leases the vehicle(s).
Vanpool(s) must also be in compliance with mass transit
rules including Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
provisions, and be open to the public and that availability
must be made known. Other forms of public participation
to encourage ridesharing arrangements such as the
provision of parking spaces, use of high occupancy
vehicle (HOV) lanes, coordination or clearing house
service, do not qualify as public vanpools.

Types of Vehicles
Almost all vanpool service is operated with vans less than
21 feet in length.
Vans cost about $21,000, according to a 2004 APTA
survey including about 64% of vanpool vehicles.
A van has a typical seating capacity of 5 to 15 passengers
and is classified as a van by vehicle manufacturers. Very
rarely, a modified van (body-on-chassis van)--a
standard van that has undergone some structural changes
by another company, usually made to increase its size and
particularly its height--may be used. The seating capacity
of modified vans is approximately 9 to 18 passengers.

Types of Service
Vanpool service is operated in two ways. Either transit
agency vehicles are leased to companies or directly to
volunteer drivers, or the service is contracted to a vanpool

High-floor vans require all riders except the person next
to the driver to climb into the van from street level through
a sliding door on the side of the van. A few such vans
accommodate wheelchair-bound and other riders who
cannot climb steps by using a retractable lift that raises
and lowers persons and equipment between street and
van floor levels.

Accessibility
Vanpool service is not required to be accessible by law, as
are other modes, since the passengers are voluntary
participants. Rather, a vanpool would be assigned an
accessible van if a person in need of such a van became a
vanpool participant.

Low-floor vans generally use a side sliding door for
passengers and have a level floor in the entire passengerseating area. Only a short retractable ramp is necessary
to accommodate wheelchairs and those who cannot
bridge the gap between van and street level.

An accessible vehicle is a public transportation revenue
vehicle that does not restrict access, is usable, and
provides allocated space and/or priority seating for
individuals who use wheelchairs.

CANADIAN DATA
Data in this section are extracted from the Summary of
Canadian Transit Statistics and predecessor documents
published each year by APTA's Canadian counterpart, the
Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA). Although
definitions of terms are generally similar to U.S. terms, many
are somewhat different, and comparison of Canadian and
U.S. data can be misleading.
Public transportation use in Canada (as well as in the rest of
the world) has historically been much greater than the U.S.
because it has a less automobile-dependent culture.
Consequently, measures of public transportation use will be
considerably higher than the U.S.
For more Canadian statistical information, see CUTA's web
site, www.cutaactu.on.ca.

The Societe de Transport de Montreal operates the only rubber-tired
rail system in Canada.
